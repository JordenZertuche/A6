try {
            avatarView = new ImageView(individual.getAvatar());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            //if this exception is thrown, then the program will print out the error message
            // as well as the program will crash and show the user nothing other than the box
            System. out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }

Error: Invalid URL: Illegal char <?> at index 11: avatar name?
I created this for those that tried inputting an avatar name. It can be replicated for the rest of the classes as nothing will happen to the program if inputted; however, if one submits anything, it should just return this error.

This is the example that is the easiest to replicate hence my reasoning for their inclusion under the avatar label area.
